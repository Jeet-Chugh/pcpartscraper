# Documentation  

###### Documentation is split into 2 sections. First is the 'Part' Class and second is the 'Query' Function.  

---  

#### 'Part' Class:  

Part takes in an input of a URL as a string, and has many methods that return specific chunks of data.  

Example1 Part:    *'/product/jxJwrH/intel-cpu-bx80623i52400' is a WD Blue 1tb Hard drive*  

Example2 Part:   *'/product/jxJwrH/intel-cpu-bx80623i52400'* is an Intel i5-2400 Proccesor  

**Import:**  

``from pcpartscraper.scraper import Part``  

**Instantiation:**  

``part1 = Part('/product/jxJwrH/intel-cpu-bx80623i52400') # Takes in url string (no .com)``  

``part2 = Part('/product/jxJwrH/intel-cpu-bx80623i52400') # Organize different parts in variables``  

#### **'Part' Methods:**  

##### methods return None if encountering Errors  

---  

``Part('url').name()``  

returns a string containing the name of the part.  

 (Western Digital 1 TB 3.5" Hard Drive, etc.)  

---  

``Part('url').type()``  

returns a string containing the type of the part  

(Storage, Memory, Video Card, CPU Cooler, etc.)  

---  

`Part('url').amazon_link()`  

returns a string containing the URL to the amazon listing for the product, if available. returns None if unavailable.  

('https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004EBUXIA?tag=pcpapi-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1', etc)  

---  

`Part('url').price()`  

returns a float value for the cheapest price available for the part.  

(34.99, 93.01, 45.62, etc.)  

---  

`Part('url').advanced_specs()`  

returns a dictionary containing key/value pairs that correspond to the "specifications" sidebar for the part  

Example Dictionary:`{'model':'Intel','Core Clock':'3.2Ghz','TDP':'95W','Socket':'LGA1155'}`  

---  

`Part('url').url()`  

returns a string containing the runnable link for the part.  

(https://pcpartpicker.com/product/jxJwrH/intel-cpu-bx80623i52400, etc.)  

---  

`Part('url').rating()`  

returns a float value containing the review rating score, out of 5, for the part.  

(3.6, 4.7, 1.3, 5.0, etc.)  

---  

`Part('url').reviews(results=1)`  

inputs = results. The number of reviews that you want to pull from the part page.  

returns a list containing x amount of text-reviews for a part. Reviews are from the part page, and are unfiltered.  

(['really fast and good looking!','runs a little hot, but runs games extremely well!','Not good, waste of money.'], etc.)  

---  

#### 'Query' Function:  

Query takes in (url as a string), (results as an int), (exclude_laptops as a bool)   

**Import:**  

``from pcpartscraper.scraper import Query``  

**Instantiation:**  

``result_list = Query(search_term='ryzen 5',results=1,exclude_laptops=True)``  

#### **'Query' Inputs:**  

##### returns a list containing 'Part' classes pertaining to results.  

---  

``Query(search_term='')``  

search_term is the keywords for finding a part through query. Main "searching" input.  

 (Western Digital , G-SKill, Cooler Master Hyper, 8gb RAM, etc.)  

---  

``Query(results=3)``  

results is the number of results that you want to be returned in the returning list  

The default value for result is 3, and the max is 20. > Results = More time usage  

 (6, 11, 3, 5, 1, 20, 13, etc.)  

---  

``Query(exclude_laptops='search for a part')``  

Because of the laptop update to pcpartpicker.com, searching for parts often only result in laptops  

exclude_laptops will ensure that no elements in the returning list contain instances of laptops.  

The default value for exclude_laptops is True  

 (True, False)  

---  

`Query('ryzen 5',3,True)`  

This example would return a list containing 3 'Part' objects for the top 3 searches pertaining to 'ryzen',excluding laptops.  

A return would look like this  

`print(Query('ryzen',3,True))` --> [Part Object at x,Part Object at y,Part Object at z]
